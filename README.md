# flickr-geo-api

This project uses [Flickr App Garden API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) for getting pictures given a geolocation point (lat,lon). It captures X,Y coordinates when a user clicks on the map and traslate them to lat,lon coordinates. 

If you want to test this project make sure to include an API_KEY.js file with a constant declaration of your personal API key:

For example:
`const API_KEY: 'a8sd7a7989d87a9d8ad7';`

This project is only for testing the **App Graden** API service.
